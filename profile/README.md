# 🧪 PwnFuzz

**PwnFuzz** is all about diving into security research, fuzzing cool stuff, and messing around with exploits — while sharing tools and ideas along the way. We're here to learn, build, and maybe break a few things (responsibly).

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- 🔍 Exploit Engineering – Kernel/userland exploitation, privilege escalation
- 🛡️ OS Internals & Security – Deep inspection of Windows & Linux attack surfaces
- 🤖 Fuzzing & Automation – Custom fuzzers, bug discovery pipelines
- 💣 Proof-of-Concepts – Demonstrations of real-world vulnerabilities

## 🧠 Featured Projects

- [POCs](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/POCs): PoCs for Windows driver bugs, kernel vulnerabilities, and other CVEs. Educational and weaponized responsibly. 
- [PwnLand](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/PwnLand): Living knowledge base for exploit techniques, binary internals, and offensive tooling workflows.  
- [WindowsHeapMastery](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/WindowsHeapMastery): Research repo focused on Windows heap internals and related exploitation vectors. Great for understanding LFH, segment heaps, etc.
- [WinDriver-EXP](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/WinDriver-EXP): Collection of proof-of-concepts for vulnerable Windows drivers, tailored for kernel exploitation. 
- [BYOVDFinder](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/BYOVDFinder): Identifies LOLDrivers that are not blocked by the active HVCI policy — ideal for BYOVD scenarios.
- [Patch_Tuesday](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/patch-tuesday): A site that efficiently tracks Microsoft Patch Tuesday updates for vulnerability analysis and patch diffing.
