# 🧪 PwnFuzz

**PwnFuzz** is an open‑source Offensive R&D lab dedicated to exploit engineering, kernel security, fuzzing, and automation. We build tools, write PoCs, and share technical deep-dives to empower the security research community.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- 🔍 Exploit Engineering – Kernel/userland exploitation, privilege escalation
- 🛡️ OS Internals & Security – Deep inspection of Windows & Linux attack surfaces
- 🤖 Fuzzing & Automation – Custom fuzzers, bug discovery pipelines
- 💣 Proof-of-Concepts – Demonstrations of real-world vulnerabilities

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 📦 [POCs](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/POCs)  
PoCs for Windows driver bugs, kernel vulnerabilities, and other CVEs. Educational and weaponized responsibly. 

### 📘 [PwnLand](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/PwnLand)  
Living knowledge base for exploit techniques, binary internals, and offensive tooling workflows.  

### 🧠 [WindowsHeapMastery](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/WindowsHeapMastery)  
Research repo focused on Windows heap internals and related exploitation vectors. Great for understanding LFH, segment heaps, etc.

### 🔍 [WinDriver-EXP](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/WinDriver-EXP)  
Collection of proof-of-concepts for vulnerable Windows drivers, tailored for kernel exploitation. 

### 🧰 [BYOVDFinder](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/BYOVDFinder)  
Identifies LOLDrivers that are not blocked by the active HVCI policy — ideal for BYOVD scenarios.

### 🗓️ [Patch_Tuesday](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/patch-tuesday)  
A site that efficiently tracks Microsoft Patch Tuesday updates for vulnerability analysis and patch diffing.
